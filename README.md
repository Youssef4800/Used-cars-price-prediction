# Used Cars Price Prediction

This project is a machine learning model designed to predict the price of used cars based on various features like mileage, brand, transmission type, and more. The project leverages data preprocessing, feature engineering, and a Random Forest Regressor to generate accurate price predictions.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- **Model Training:** Training a Random Forest model for regression to predict the prices of used cars.
- **User Interaction:** Includes functionality to allow users to input custom car features and obtain price predictions.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Visualized the modelâ€™s performance through metrics like Mean Squared Error and a comparison chart between actual and predicted values.

## Libraries and Tools

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Notebook:** Jupyter Notebook

## How It Works

1. **Data Input:** The dataset is loaded and analyzed for missing or irrelevant data.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Converts raw data into a structured format suitable for the model.
3. **Training the Model:** The Random Forest Regressor is trained on the processed dataset.
4. **Prediction:** Users can input features like car brand, mileage, and transmission type to predict the price of a used car.

## Visualization

The notebook includes a comparison plot between actual and predicted prices for a better understanding of the model's accuracy.
